Options Framework Importer
==========================

Users will see "Import / Export Options" tab in on the "Theme Options page" generated by the Options Framework plugin. 

On the site whose settings you wish to export, copy the text from the Export Settings text area. Go to the site where you wish to import the options, paste the copied settings into the Import Settings text area, and click "Import".

Note that this only works if both sites are running the same theme. 

This is not extensively tested or supported, so use as your own risk.
